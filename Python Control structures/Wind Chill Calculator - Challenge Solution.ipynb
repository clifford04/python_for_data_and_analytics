    "During the winter months, the temperature is often described as what it really feels like outside. This is also known as the wind chill.<br>\n",

    "### Challenge\n",
    "Using the formula for wind chill given below, create a \"chained-if statement\" to ensure that the formula works for the following conditions:\n",
    "- the temperature must be at or below 50 degrees\n",
    "- the wind speed must be at least 3 miles per hour\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume temperature is in degrees Fahrenheit and that wind speed is in miles per hour.<br><br>\n",
    "Provide a message for the user if the test condition fails.<br>\n",
    "Round the wind chill to a whole number (integer value).<br>\n",
    "Make sure to test all conditions.<br>"
