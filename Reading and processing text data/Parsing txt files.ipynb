    "** Parsing .txt Files **\n",
    "\n",
    "This example introduces the Python concepts necessary to use data from .txt files. We can create these files in a number of ways. For example, we could use a text editor to type in and save the data. We could also download the data and then save it in a file. Regardless of how the file is created, Python will allow us to manipulate the contents.\n",

    "** Finding a File On Your Disk **\n",
    "\n",
    "Opening a file requires that you and Python agree about the location of the file on your disk. The way that files are located on disk is by their path. You can think of the filename as the short name for a file, and the path as the full name. For example, on a Mac if you save the file filename.txt in your home directory, then the path to that file is /Users/yourname/filename.txt. On a Windows machine, the path looks a bit different but the same principles are in use. For example, on Windows the path might be C:\\Users\\yourname\\hello.txt.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can access files in folders, also called directories, under your home directory by adding a slash and the name of the folder. For example, if you had a file called program.py in a folder called Spring2018 that was inside a folder called PythonProjects under your home directory, then the full name for program.py stored in your folder would be /Users/yourname/PythonProjects/Spring2018/program.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hereâ€™s the important rule to remember: If your file and your Python program are in the same directory, you can simply use the filename to refer to your file. If your file and your Python program are in different directories then you should use the path to the file. For the sake of this example, we will assume that the .txt file is in the same directory as our Python program.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Video Game Sales and Ratings **\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, suppose we have a file called Video_Game_Sales.txt that contains the following data for video game titles: Rank, Name, Platform, Year of Release, Genre, Publisher, North America Sales, Europe Sales, Japan Sales, Other Sales, and Global Sales. We will take a look at using this file to develop some insights and statistics.\n"
